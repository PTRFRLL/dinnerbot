![Dinner Bot](examples/main.png)

DinnerBot is a Discord bot that listens on a specfic channel for PUBG win screenshots and responds with  **WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER** and some emoji üêî üèÜ üçΩ if the image is a winning screenshot. Useful for `chicken-dinner-receipt` channels where only winning screenshots are posted. Keeps track of win count for each tagged users.

### Image Comparison
Winning screenshots are determined by comparing the uploaded screenshot with a known win screenshot ([base.png](./data/img/base.png)). If the uploaded screenshot is within a certain similarity score to the base image, a win is awared.



## Getting Started

Create a new dev app on Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). 

Under the Bot section, click Add Bot and copy your bot's Token.

Edit the config.js file with your discord bot token and the channel-id of the channel you want it to listen on.

Add the bot to your server using [bot authorization flow](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots):

Example link (note CLIENT_ID != TOKEN):
```
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=75840
```

Start the bot with:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Commands

### !wins

Use `!wins` command to see current win count, you can tag users to show their count as well.

Ex. `!wins @Dirka @tgruenen24` produces:

## Manual Wins  

If an image is uploaded that scores too high but it should be a win, the user marked as `AUTH_USER` in config.js can mention the bot and it will award the win anyway (this only works for the last non-win). Dinner-Bot will respond with a random phrase taken from the `good` array in config.js

If anyone else mentions the bot, it will repond with a response from the `bad` array:

## Configuration

Edit the [config.js](./config.js) to change these settings.

```js
IMG_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 20000, //if the image score is below this number it's awared a win (20,000 is arbitrary based off my testing)
LOGMODE: 'prod', //prod or debug
AUTH_USERS: { 
    //users/roles specified here can award wins that scored too high
    users: [''], //array of user ids
    roles: [''] //array of role names
},
BOT_RESPONSES_GOOD: good, //array of 'good' responses from bot, replied when AUTH_USER mentions bot
BOT_RESPONSES_BAD: bad //array of 'bad' responses from bot, replied when non-AUTH_USER mentions bot
```
